![logo-small](${root}/design/xdocc-logo.svg) is a software that compiles documents to HTML documents. The idea is to have a file system-based structure with documents that can be viewed with any browser. With XDocC and the support of other tools such as WebDAV or modern file-managers, a small to medium-sized CMS can be realized. XDocC currently runs as a daemon and incrementally compiles changed documents. Supported formats are currently TEXTILE, HTML (pass-through), PNG, JPG, TXT. Planned formats are ODT, WIKI, and PDF. As the name suggests, XDocC is experimental and many features have not been implemented yet.u
